# Set Initial Map Location

![Set Initial Map Location App](set-initial-map-location.png)

The **Set Initial Map Location** app is the most basic Map app for the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/android/).
It shows how to inflate a ```MapView``` in the layout XML of the activity, create a ```Map``` with a ```BasemapType``` and bind the ```Map``` to the ```MapView```.  By default, this map supports basic zooming and panning operations.  A reference to the ```MapView``` is set within the ```onCreate``` method of the ```Activity``` which can be used at the start template to build your first application.
