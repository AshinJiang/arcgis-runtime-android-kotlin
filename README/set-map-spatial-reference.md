# Set Map Spatial Reference

![Set Map Spatial Reference App](set-map-spatial-reference.png)

The Set Map Spatial Reference sample app demonstrates how to create a ```Map``` with the **WORLD_BONNE** equal-area projection that has a true scale along the central meridian and all parallels.  The sample creates an ```ArcGISMapImageLayer``` that can reproject itself to the ```Map```'s spatial reference.  Not all layer types can be reprojected, like ```ArcGISTiledLayer```, and will fail to draw if their spatial reference is not the same as the ```Map```'s spatial reference.
