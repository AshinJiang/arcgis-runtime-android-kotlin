# ArcGIS Map Image Layer URL

![ArcGIS Map Image Layer App](map-image-layer.png)

The ArcGIS Map Image Layer from URL app is the most basic Map app for the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/android/) using an ```ArcGISMapImageLayer``` operational layer from an ArcGIS Online service URL.
It shows how to inflate a MapView in the layout XML of the activity, create a Map Image Layer from an ArcGIS Online service URL and bind that to a ```Basemap```.  The ```Basemap``` is used to create a ```Map``` which is used inside of the ```MapView```.
By default, this map supports basic zooming and panning operations.
